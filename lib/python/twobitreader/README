This is a modified version of the twobitreader v2.9 package, available from:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twobitreader

Several modifications were made to the get_slice() method of the 
TwoBitSequence class. One compensatory modification was made to
the __str__() method as well. These are documented in the source code.
