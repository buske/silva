The current weighted matrix values (release 3.0) and the consensus motifs obtained with these four SR proteins are shown below; the height of each letter reflects the frequency of each nucleotide at a given position, after adjusting for background nucleotide composition. At each position, the nucleotides are shown from top to bottom in order of decreasing frequency; orange letters indicate above-background frequencies. (The pictogram representation method was described by Burge and colleagues (Burge, C.B.,Tuschl, T., Sharp, P.A. in The RNA world II, 525-560, CSHL press, 1999).

The thresholds are values above which we consider a score for a given sequence to be significant (high-score motif).

Our default threshold values are set as the median of the highest score for each sequence in a set of 30 randomly-chosen 20-nt sequences (from the starting pool used for functional Selex).

The matrices for splice sites were derived from constitutive exons (data from dbCASE, database of classified alternative splicing events, unpublished) and the thresholds correspond to the first quantile of all splice site scores. The branch site matrix was derived the data generated by Kol et al. 2005, Hum Mol Genet 14: 1559-1568) and the threshold is arbitrarily set to zero.







NOT ALL HIGH-SCORES are ESEs !

The presence of a high-score motif in a sequence does NOT necessarily identify that sequence as an exonic splicing enhancer in its native context. For example, a nearby silencer element may prevent the SR protein from binding.
The default threshold values are based on statistical analysis and empirical data, but they are still somewhat arbitrary. Any refinements or updates will be incorporated as they become available
There is at best only a rough correlation between numerical scores and ESE activity of high-score motifs. For example, the maximum score is not necessarily the most effective ESE.
The score values of ESEs corresponding to different SR proteins cannot be compared to each other.
The program currently searches the ESE motifs corresponding to four SR proteins. There are several other SR proteins for which the ESE motifs have not yet been identified, at least by the strategy used here.
The ESE motifs were identified using human SR proteins. Their relevance to other species depends on the extent of conservation of each SR protein.
